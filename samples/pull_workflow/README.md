When using gitlogger with a pull-request workflow, as is common with GitHub, the
history becomes even more clear. Each non-fast-forward merge into the mainline
(master) branch groups all of the commits made as part of that pull request together
in history so that it's easy to see when changes were introduced into mainline.
