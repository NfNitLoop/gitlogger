Gitlogger
=========

Gitlogger is a little utility I wrote to display git history in a more intuitive way than
`git log --graph` does. It allows you to more easily answer the question "When did this change get merged into this branch?"

See the [samples] directory for a comparison between `git log --graph` and `log` output.
