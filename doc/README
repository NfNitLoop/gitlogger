Gitlogger shows git history in a way that is more easily readable than `git
log`. It does this by showing merges as indented commits which are merged into
an unindented "mainline" (or left-hand-side) history.  It also attempts to
detect which merges were the result of a 'git pull', and treats those merges as
a merge into mainline.  This makes it easy to see when a developer's local
changes were merged into mainline and pushed.  

For samples of history via 'git log', 'git log --graph', and gitlogger, see the
samples/ directory. It contains logs taken from a sample repository in which
users Bob and Jill have pushed/pulled their changes to/from a central repo

Usage: 
cd YourGitDir
log [git-rev] | less


TODO: 
 * Automatically pipe through 'less'?
 * Wrap long commit lines.  (Use less -S for better formatting for now) 
 * Performance improvements?  (Faster way to do `git merge-base` in Python?)
